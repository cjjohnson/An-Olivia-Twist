An Olivia Twist - Website v1.0

08/03/2014 - Purchased domain name (anoliviatwist.com) Decided on hosting server (github), 
photo hosting server (plus.google.com/photos), and comment service (disqus.com). Began designing site.

09/03/2014 - Uploaded photos to server. Edited some photos. Made some very minor edits to pages,
added a short message to potential viewers.

10/03/2014 - Added some CSS for navbar. Didn't work, and I don't know what I am doing wrong. I will leave the coding to the experts.

19/03/2014 - Minor changes. Spelling fix on hompage. Fixed broken links on other pages.

20/03/2014 - Changed Google hosted banner links to reflect latest design.
