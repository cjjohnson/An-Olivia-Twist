	<p><h2>About The Film</h2></p>
	<p>An Olivia Twist is the story of a young girl who takes a chance and discovers a world
		much bigger than her own. A man who, obsessed with helping others, neglects the one
		who needs him the most. And friends, who discover the joy of showing Christ's love to
		those around them. It's the story of Oliver... with a Twist.'

	<p><h2>About Us</h2></p>
	<p>For the last few years our family has been making films. We have made feature films,
		short films, commercials, and a documentary. Our vision is to make children's
		films that influence the next genereration for Christ. Children are our future,
		but in our modern culture they are bombarded by subtle influences that shape who
		they become. Our goal is to make films that parents can feel good about, knowing
		that we are encouraging their children to become the men and women that God wants
		them to be.</p>
